# MissileCommand

This project was part of my "Programming 2" course at university. The goal was to reproduce the arcade game "Missile Command" as true to the original as possible in java. 

The code written is my own. Only the class "GameView" was provided by my professor Dr. Andreas Berl for graphical output and cheating-control.
